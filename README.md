# PHP / MySQL - Loup-Garou Web

## ...But why ?

After working on [this school project](https://github.com/Rcern/manager), I had some free time and decided to waste it... to spend it on building a simple website, on something I like.

This is basically a simple website displaying the different roles one can play during a party of "Loup-Garou", and I hoped that I could implement some other features :
* Add roles
* Create a party and manage the different players / roles
* Manage said party
* See statistic views of all the previous parties (how many players, how many times a role was played, how many times it won...)

But, since my skills in Back-end (most notably, in MySQL) are limited, I didn't implement these parts.


Note : most of the "cool looking graphical stuff" was made using [Google's Material](https://www.material.io)
